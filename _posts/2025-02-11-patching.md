When testing Python code, you may need to patch objects to avoid side effects or to simulate certain behaviors. In this post, I will show you how to patch objects in Python using the `unittest.mock` module.

I will structure this post according to the target object to be patched. I will cover the following cases:

- Patching a function in a module
- Patching a class method
- Patching a class property

## Patching a function in a module

## Patching a class method

## Patching a class property
